# As 12 Camadas da Personalidade

A Portuguese-language educational landing page exploring the psychological framework of "The 12 Layers of Personality" developed by Professor Olavo de Carvalho.

## Overview

This project is a single-page HTML article that presents a comprehensive exploration of personality development through twelve distinct psychological layers. The page is designed as a long-form educational piece that combines philosophical insights with practical self-reflection exercises.

## Content Description

The article addresses the question: **"Why do you keep suffering the same way — year after year?"**

It introduces readers to Prof. Olavo de Carvalho's theory of personality development, which posits that:
- Human maturation occurs in distinct stages/layers
- Each layer has a specific type of pain or challenge associated with it
- Individuals can become "stuck" at a particular layer until they resolve its core issues
- Understanding which layer you're in is crucial for personal growth and healing

### The 12 Layers

The framework covers twelve developmental layers, including:

1. **Ontologia** (Ontology) — The body and basic existence
2. **Hereditariedade** (Heredity) — Family patterns and inherited traits
3. **Educação** (Education) — Learned behaviors and conditioning
4. **Identidade Social** (Social Identity) — Social roles and expectations
5. **Identidade Pessoal** (Personal Identity) — Individual self-concept
6. **Vocação** (Vocation) — Life purpose and calling
7. **Projetos** (Projects) — Goals and aspirations
8. **Relacionamentos** (Relationships) — Interpersonal dynamics
9. **Sexualidade** (Sexuality) — Sexual identity and expression
10. **Cultura** (Culture) — Cultural influences and values
11. **Conhecimento** (Knowledge) — Understanding and wisdom
12. **Transcendência** (Transcendence) — Spiritual development

Each layer includes:
- A description of the developmental stage
- The characteristic pain or struggle associated with it
- How to identify if you're stuck at this layer
- Guidance on how to progress beyond it
